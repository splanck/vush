.SH NAME
vush \- simple UNIX shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vush
.RI [ scriptfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
vush is a lightweight UNIX shell supporting command execution,
pipelines, command chaining with ';', '&&' and '||',
environment variable expansion, wildcard matching for '*' and '?', and
background jobs.  When a
\fIscriptfile\fP is supplied, commands are read from that file
instead of standard input.  A `#` outside of quotes begins a comment
and causes the rest of the line to be ignored.
