.TH VUSH 1 "" "vush 0.1.0"
.SH NAME
vush \- simple POSIX-style shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vush
.RI [ scriptfile ]
.br
.BR vush " -c " command
.SH DESCRIPTION
vush is a lightweight POSIX-style shell focused on providing the
essentials for interactive and scripted use. It supports job control,
pipelines, redirection and standard shell expansions. See README.md or
docs/vushdoc.md for a full feature overview.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c command
Execute the provided command string and exit.
.TP
.BR -V , --version
Print version information and exit.
.SH STARTUP
If no script file or -c option is given, \fB~/.vushrc\fP is read before the first prompt if it exists. When the \fBENV\fP variable is set, the file it names is processed afterward.
.SH BUILTINS
Built-in commands cover common shell tasks such as variable
management, flow control and job handling. Refer to README.md for the
complete list.
The \fBtest\fP builtin also supports binary comparisons \fIfile1\fP \-nt
\fIfile2\fP, \fIfile1\fP \-ot \fIfile2\fP and \fIfile1\fP \-ef \fIfile2\fP.
The \fBtrap\fP builtin lists available signal names when invoked with \-l.
History can be manipulated using \fBfc\fP.  The \-n flag omits numbers when
listing, \-r reverses the order and \-s re-executes the selected command with
optional text substitution.
.SH SHELL FEATURES
Parameter, command and arithmetic expansion, wildcard matching,
functions, history and background jobs are available. Expanded
examples reside in docs/vushdoc.md.
The redirection operator \fB>|\fP forces truncation even when the \fBnoclobber\fP option is set.
