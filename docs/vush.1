.TH VUSH 1 "" "vush"
.SH NAME
vush \- simple UNIX shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vush
.RI [ scriptfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
vush is a lightweight UNIX shell supporting command execution,
pipelines, command chaining with ';', '&&' and '||',
environment variable expansion using \fB$VAR\fP or \fB${VAR}\fP (with "$?" storing the last exit status),
command substitution using backticks or \fB$(\fPcmd\fB)\fP,
wildcard matching for '*' and '?', input and output redirection with
\'<\', \'\>', \'>>\', \"2>\", \"2>>\" and \"&>\", and background jobs.  When a
\fIscriptfile\fP is supplied, commands are read from that file
instead of standard input.  A `#` outside of quotes begins a comment
and causes the rest of the line to be ignored.
When run interactively, arrow keys allow editing the current line and
recalling previous commands from history.  `Ctrl-A` or the Home key moves
the cursor to the start of the line, `Ctrl-E` or End moves to the end and
`Ctrl-U` clears from the cursor back to the beginning.
If \fB~/.vushrc\fP exists, commands from this file are executed before
the first prompt is shown.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B cd [dir]
Change the current directory. Without an argument it switches to \fB$HOME\fP.
Both \fB~\fP and \fB~user\fP expand to home directories using the password
database. After a successful change \fB$PWD\fP and \fB$OLDPWD\fP are updated.
Using \fBcd -\fP prints and switches to \fB$OLDPWD\fP.
Example: \fBcd ~otheruser\fP
.TP
.B pushd dir
Push the current directory onto a stack and switch to \fIdir\fP. The stack is
printed after the change.
.TP

Switch to the directory most recently pushed with \fBpushd\fP. The stack is
printed after the switch.

.SH REDIRECTION
Standard input can be redirected with '<'.  Standard output may be
redirected with '>' or '>>' to append.  Likewise, file descriptor 2
(standard error) can be redirected using '2>' or '2>>'.
Both descriptors may be sent to the same file with '&>' or '>&file'.
File descriptors can also be duplicated, e.g. '2>&1' or '>&2'.
